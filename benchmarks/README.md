Benchmarks
==========

This folder contains benchmarks to asses the performance of QuOp\_MPI on a cluster using Slurm job scheduling.

After running the ****.slurm scripts located under 'programs/', generate plots by running the programs in 'plots/'.

The generated plots and simulation results correspond to the 'Performance' section of the QuOp\_MPI article.

NOTE: Results used in the QuOp\_MPI article have been included.
